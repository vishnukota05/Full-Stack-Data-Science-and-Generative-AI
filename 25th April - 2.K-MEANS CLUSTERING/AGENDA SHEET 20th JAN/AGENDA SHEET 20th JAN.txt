sql db vd no sql db vs vector db & yesterday we are completed demo 
==== python introduction 
1- why python ? what is the power of python 
		if you guys install vscode, pycharm , anaconda -- you can practise using it 
2- student dint install please use google colab ( goolge software)
		no need to by heart any thing in programming language
3- father of python - guidoe van rosam
4- python name came from -- monty python flying circus 
5- python is very powerfull tool for -- bigdata, ds, gen ai, llm model
		azur cloude -- python, db - python ( python is everything)
6- python was released on 1989 (feb 20th 1991)
7- Java released on 1995 but no one use python till 2015 
		( ml -- borns + python || ai - python very library or framework 
8- platform independetly 
		no need to write separae code for win, mac, linux
		just write 1 code execute every platform 


Need to master on 3 category & python into 3 section 
	1- basic python
	2- advanced python
	3- oops python 
	4- dsa I will explain (optional) 
python : -- 4 space ( indentation) 
-------
organization -- company wil buy python for credential 
python cons -- python can not perform in mobile application like android

--- what is anaconda & why anaconda application is realy used for 
Anaconda is an open source[9][10] data science and artificial intelligence
distribution platform for Python and R programming languages. Developed by Anaconda,

pelase install software -- to start work regurlar session 
Software Installation: https://t.ly/YoRAA
---
IDE ( INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONEMENT)
--	
user or developer write the code, run the code, read the code, fix the error , 
when you write you will get bug (error)
developer to debug 
---
famous ide --> vs code | jupyter notebook | spyder | pycharm | google colab
=== python interpreter & compiler 
interpreter -- execute the code line by line
compilier -- executure entire code at once

python variable -->
--
syntax -->
variable namne = value | a = 5 
a is the varaible store 5 int value 
b = 5.5 
b  
--------------
python if you write any code try to write the 1st letter of the concept 

1 - what is variable 
	variable also called as object also called as identifier which helps to assign a value 
2 - how to assigne variable 
	variable name = value  but (value != variable)
3- rules to define python variable 
	 1- variable == case sensitive 
	 2- variable cannot start with digit but end with digit 
	 3- variable no special characteer is allowed except _ #
	 4- keyword or reserved word cannot be variable 
	 5- variable has no lenght limit

ONLINE TEAM NON-TECHNICAL ATTEND SESSION IN OFFLINE MODEL
variabale declaration == object declration  == identider declaration 
------
when you want to print only 1 variable -- print() not required 
when you print more variable -- print() 
by defaul every day use print()
-------
Function 2 type & function always endwith() 	
	inbuild() -- print()
	userdefine() 
	
^^^^^^^^^ 24th

Agenda for today session -->
	Data type 
	Type casting
	Github createion 
	Linkedin createion 
	
-- complex data type
		a + bj  ( a - real part | b - imaginary part | j - squre root of -1)
		only j letter is small or capital 
------
tricks to remeber -->
---
: --> bydefaul 4 spaces ( indentation)
fun always ends with ()
everytime we call with dot(.)
---
python data type we are completed
==============
type casting -->
	from other datatype to int & float
	from other datatypd to complex, str, bool
============
int -- data type 
fam() -- fam function with 0 argument 
family( dad, mom) -- dad, mom -- argument or parameter 
family1( d, m, s, d) -- 4 parameter 
---------
llm model --
	llama3 model trained with 405B parameter 
		you cannot build llm model in cpu 
------------
house( labour, daily wage, bricks, sand, cement, etc ------) 
True -- system consider as True only 

when we assigne true with opter +-*/ -- system understand is \
TRUE - 1 & FALSE - 0

steps to downlad classnote from google classrrom
----

dear team i will answer all of your question at last 
how to upload & download classnotes from google classrrom 

1- download winzip or winrar file from google 
2- google classroom 
3- just click on file which i shared 
4- right top corner 3 dots 
5- click on that - open in new window
6- download
7- rightclick - extract - all the file
8- just check the file extension 
	 .xlcs
	 .doc
	 .pdf
	 .ipynb ( interactive python notebook)
	 .py ( python file) 
	 
.ipynb & .py you need to open using jupyter file 

9- still if you have any question no worry i will explain later or 
	mentor can take your screen acces they can guide you 
	
PYTHON DATASTRUCTURE 
	inbuld ds 
	user defind ds 

data type --> we need to define only 1 value 
data structure --> we have declare more then 1 value 
	a = 5

matrix - collection of datastructure
datastrucute - collection of data types

python inbuild ds -->
	list 
	tuple
	set
	dict

append() - add the element or value at the end of the list 
	append only 1 argument user can pass
		

 list insid list -- nested list
 for inside for loop -- nested for 
 
inbuild or built in --> list is inbuild datastructure 
---
string indexing-->
---
forward index --> left - right 
backward index --> right - left 

slicing -->
	forward slicing
	backward slicing
	step slicing
	
FORWARD SLICING -->
---
[2 : 7] - left index 2nd index : 7th right indexing 
			2nd index : ( n-1) formula right index ( 7-1)
	OUTPUT -- 2nd - 6th 
--	
BACKWARD SLICING :
[-7 : -1] -- LEFT INDEX - 7 : -1-1 
	-7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2 
	
slicing -->

matrix --> n = n-1 everytime this formula should by apply to right index
---
step slicing -->
---
[1:10:3]
print the element from 1st index to 10th (n-1) 
	3 should be step count
	
empyty slice -- all element


append() - add the element at last
copy() - copy list
reverse() - reverse the element
remove() -- remove 1st element 
string indexg ( 2 type
	
	forward index  
	backward index 

slcing
	: - entire element
	forward slice
	backward slice
	step slice 

^^^^^^ 28th 
when ever you upload your notes in classroom make sure upload pdf 
---
Basic python 
---
string vs raw string

ml, nlp
when we read any file from the specif folder location we must need to use 
	r before the location ( raw string) 
	i will explain this clarity on pandas , session indepth)
	
string
raw string (r) - detect the path location 

_ == it store previous value or previos results
	where to apply in future ( open cv model 

s[1:] --> print the element from 1st indext till last 
s[:7] --> print the element from 1st indext to n-1 (6th index)

i wnat you to change the string 'fine' to 'dine'

string is immutable -- not chagaable 

no constant concept in python . we have only variable 
---
PYTHON BASIC OPERATORS -->
---
ARITHMETIC  ( + - * / // % **) 
ASSIGNMENT ( =, +=, -=, *=, /=, //==)
RELATIONAL (we are using this operator for comparing)
			> , < , >=, <=, ==, !=

LOGICAL ( and , or, not)
UNARY ( ONLY 1 OPERATOR)  - OPERATOR 
	
and operator ==>
	1 and 1 = 1 (rest of them are 0)

or operator ==>
	0 or 0 = 0 (rest of them are 1
--------
NUMBER SYSTEM CONVERTION -->
--------
binary number system (base value 2) 
	0 & 1 
octal number system (base value 8) 
	0 -- 7
decimal number system (base value 10) 
	0-9
hexa decimal number system ( base value 16)
	0-9 , a-10, b-11, c-12, d-13, e-14, f-15

a, b = 5, 6

a = 6
b = 5


xor -- xclusive or 

swap the 2 variable
	1- using temp (3rd variable)
	2- using operator
	3- can you swap using bit number ( use print(0b101| ob 110)
	4- using XOR ( i will explain tomorrow)
	5- a, b = b, a 

slicing & indexing concept in string datatype
slicing & indexing oncept we undersin list datastrucute
slicing & indexing we will used matrix
slicing & index conpcet we will machine leanring 


l[::-1] -- print the element revers wiser

Indexing, slicing


append() - append the element or value at last 
remove() - remove value from the list 
pop() - pop the element or value by index ( bydefault is at last)
	pop(1) - 1st index value will elimiated 
copy() - copy the list 
insert() - insert the value before index 
	makes ure insert required bydefault 2 argument
		1st arg - index position 
		2nd arg - value 
		value will add before index 
clear() - clear the elmenet from the list 
	del the use del keyword 
reverse() - reverse the list 

list is mutable (changaable) hashable

Client - ESPN , STAR SPORTS 
use case -- they have dataset ipl cricket team dataset 
7pm batch - dataanlyst 
company - NIT 

CLINET -- NIT ( 
PROBLEM STATEMENT --
		PLEASE ANALYST THE DATA AND FIND THE TRENDS, PATTERN, INSIGHT OF THE DATASET)
NIT - if you analyst the data theny nit manager and you talk to the client 

based on your analyst if the client is satified busines will increate
salry will increa, promotion increate 
you got new client ( more hiring ) 
========

1- the import functin numpy i explain in the classes 
2- numpy all function document i shared 
3- easy if you have any question on numpy function ( connect to the mentor)
4- not require to teach like kids by every function 
5- math 1000table ( 30 tbale) but you make 1000 multication 
6- numpy what important things thats good enough
7- i will give another document , 4hr do interview, 
8- we will project in numpy + plt + panda + seaborn 


the one who analyse historical data & find insight, trends, pattern 
	is called data anlayst using tools called sql, python, eda, excel, libra, table, power bi 

we have 10yr historical data 


OFFLINE -- many of the student attend online 

we import the dataset
print the matrix

if any day if you not feel well sometime you divert to the class 
-- once review the class 
-- dont take recoding ( classnotes, )
-- before joined please review review what are topic i covered
-- review that it
-- dont i didnt able to complete

simple linear ( 1 iv & 1 dv) == y = mx+ c
	what is m , c, what is x == i will expaline regression algorithm
only 1 iv & 1 dv 

Multiple linear == (y = m1x1 + m2x2+C)

who expert at code -- he will never be datascientis t
analytics thinkging 

in organization when every you do any project regard to machine learning
	identify dependent variabel 

business -- housing 

you must need to understnad attribute very well

analyse the data with only relavant attribute or you build ml model only using relavant attribute
If you build the ml model using irrelavant attribute then MULTICOLLINEARITY OR OVERFITTING will happens

EDA -> 7 TECHNIQUE 

	1- VARIABLE IDENTIFICATION
			DV
			IV
			RELAVANT ATTRIBUTE 
			IRRELAVANT ATTRIBUTE 
			
2- UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS -- plot the graph using 1 variable 

3- BIVARIATE ANALYSIS -- plot the graph using 2 variable
		New concept CORELATION 
	
	CORELATION - relation between 2 variable 
			range of coreation is -1 to 1
	0-1 = +ve corelation ( when you build the model relavant attribute)
	-1 - 0 = -ve corelation
	0 - no coreation ( ml model ) 

if you anlays the data with irrelavant attribute ( model accuracy will reduce) 

4- outlier detection 
		datapoint which is very far from other datapoint 
	outlier also called as anomaly detection 
	
5- missing value treatment 
	
dataset -- either you have numerical data & categorical data or else mix 

	In your dataset if any numerical data is missing then need to apply 
		mean strategy 
		median strategy 
		mode strategy 

	 in your dataset if categorical missing  -- mode strategy or neaarest neighbour 
		answer is only mode 
		nearest neighbour
		
6 : 	imputation or also we called as transformer
		number of classes = no of class variable 

imputation technique = transformer 
	transformer convert or transform categorical value to numerical value

1st transformer - Dummy variable 
2nd transformer  -- LabelEncoder 
3rd transformer -- One hot Encoder 


7: variable createion 
		from 1 variable -- we created 3 variable 
	
====
20YR ( you should know wel 
one hot encoder -- project ( ml)
cuz ( ml now ) 
===
ml mode( -- convert cat - number)

Dumy 
One 
Lable En

--- Variable createion 
--  Cat -- more attribte ( to trin ml model)

^^^^^ 20th 
If you check google 
One hot encoder == dummy variable ( this is not true)

lets do the practicle 

fresher
non - technical
technica experience in other domain 
non technical experice

isna () -- missing value 
fillna() -- fill missing vlaue with mena, median, model
	while you fill missing value for categorical data use [0] atlase
	
On techn - please take recording

^^^^^^ 21st 
	the link which i shared in the class room link is active only for today
	monday onwards you can join your permanent link 

can we do another project eda

dummy variables practicaly we learned
one hot encodeing & labelencoder this 2 transformer we will user very high on machin elearning

when i introdcue machine learning -- sklearn framework

application -- vscode 
	I know everybody install vs code in your laptop
	stramlit (end - end application using eda)

if any errro no need to be panic ( IT professional ) error will come 

EDA == FEATURE ENGINEERING TECHNIQUE 
	using eda technique we are trying to analysthe data 
	we will send the report to manager
	manger sent the report to client

today 7pm batch is learned how to read the data throught def function 
	also how to read the data using pandas framework

st.checkbox --> frontend we created check boxes
st.title --> fronet created title ( big letter)
st.write --> write a statment
st.dataframe --> created dataframe
st.cache --> cached the dataframe
st.subheader --> create subheader

non technciao -- review the class ( big loss)

you will get error 

today code -->
	import all the library
	read the data using def function 
		def function i didnt explain ( i will explain later)
	heatmap -- i dint explain i will share to later
	
guys next time onward i dint give any project class room 

	while you work if you got error you so panic -- carray 

you got erro (spend little more time)
you to little fix the bug 
extra -- today class very fast 
new thing - you cant understnd 
datasceince-- pleas ematrure 
change your thought

error will come ( spend littile on time erro)
i knw thsi will happen 
dont screa 

big problem 


non technica -- dont 


i am beg you please little spend time on error 
try to fix if not my number is ther 
admin si ther 
recording - foll

how many fo them got err (e)

learer who got error -- can you spennd some time by yourself 
immedilay help ( i will assginem frinec)
help now

database - container where data can be storeed and easily retrieve by any one 
data -- image, text, video, excel, pdf, xml 


every website in the world is connected to productiion server 

server - collection of database 

to muliple database ( server )
these server required specific room ( db ) need to installed inpremices 
server room 

cloud -- no server room -- data stored in datacenter 

server (in premises)  - data store in db

phonepya.com --- production server ( multiple database has connected together) 
	production servier is down 

website -- server (prod server) ( server = collection of databases) 

number -- structured data -- 
		to store structure data -- structured database = sql db = realational db
				cuz one table has realation with another table with primary key & foregin key 

data scientist & data analyst 
SQL DB = STRUCTURE DB = RDBMS 
		MYSQL
		ORACLE
		POSTGRES

DATA ENGINEER () always use no sql db 
Image, video, audio, stram, api, etc - unstructure data 
	NO SQL DB = UNSTRUCTURE DB -- NON RELATIONAL DBMS

drawback sql - visualize in sql 
pyspark -- data engineer 
databricks -- company later 


datascientist -- organize wher you will be sql part

	when you have clinet requirement
	you need to pull table ( iv & dv ) require to ml model 

sql develper -- he dont know what iv , dv 
	when he pull the report and give to you he  might delate the dv 

if you knw how to query then you can pull out the records

statistic is very important for machine learning 
stats concept we will implement in regression, classification 
stats not much use in llm, gen ai 
90% we will use in ml 

without stats no ml projec t

--- In the mean time advance python 
today onwards all the formula will start 

populatio - large group of entity
sample - randomly pick some individual is called sampel 

population - sample == sampling technique 
sampel - population == infernece technique 

population formulas
sample formulas

99% use case we will use only sample formula 

ml world we are deals with dataset -- all the dataset is must sample 

99% of test cases or dataset we will use sample formula 

population - z-test - parameter 
sample - t-test - statistic

====
2- type of data
	
	categorical - yes | no , cat | dog , happy mood | not mood 
	numerical data - contionuous & discrete
	
ml -->
	regression - dv  contionuous(regression model)
	classification - dv is categorical or binary 
	clustering - no dv , data is discrete 
			score -- 100 ( no more value after 100)
====
categorica - y/n, h/s, w/l, p/f, t/f, p/l ( ml-classification)
continuous  - keep increase or decrease (ml - regression)
				sales price, ticket price, salary price
discret -- no dv ( score of the student) children ( 2 , 3)
			rate of meal(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) 
====
levels of measures -->

qualitative 
	nominal  -- cannot keep them in order format ( summer, winter, rainy, autmn)
				autunm , rainy, summer 
	ordinal - rate of the meal 1,2,3,4,5,
			1- unapetizin , 2- disgustin, 3- neural 4- tasty, 5- delicious 

quantitative-->
	interval  - celcius & farenhite ( meal ) (100- 1000) -- has no 0
	ratio - length ( 0-15) 0-30) -- has 0 

how to visualize the numerical data & categorical data

skewness -- define how the data skew ( which side data stays left or right)

+ve skew == ( mean> median & mode )
	 data skew towards left & outlier is at right

0 skew = (mean = median = mode)
	data skew at center and no outlier 
	normal distribution == gausian distribution = bell curve = 0 symetry 
	
-ve skew == mode > mean & median =
	data skew towards right and outlier is at left 

every we need to consider 0 skew

Skewness measures how asymmetrical a distribution is, 
while kurtosis measures how peaked or heavy-tailed a distribution is.

+ve kurtosis = +ve skew = platykurtic ( high tailed graph) = <3

DISTRIBUTION -- distribution concept born from PROBABILIT

uniform distribution - never ever consider this  
normal distribution  

roll 1 dice ==  uniform distribution 
roll 2 dice === normal distribution 

2dice has how many side = 12 
when you roll 2dice what could be the probability of getting 1 = 0

sary 

whenever we build ml model 
we build ml model dataset ( excel sheet )
=======
z-score = x-mean/sd
ml this concept - standadscaler ( every algorith we will implat transformer) 
timeseries -- this concept ( whitenoise)
========

standarization -- standariziant is technique to convert normalstion distribution 
to standard normal distice cover mean - 0 | sd - 1 (z-score)

t-test, t-table 
can I skip this 

^^^^ 14th
z-score -- convert normal distrin to standard distribution mean - 0 & sd - 1
z-table - z-table is the statistical table to compulet z-test ( fill the value after 1-alpha)

after build reg model if model score is  1 ( 100 best model)
if score -3 ( rework againg)

if you work with multipl regression algoriytm ( more independtat ) adjusted r2

if you build regression model --( r2 & adjusted r2) 0-1

train the brain well -- test result is very good - score 96%

15days traine well no -- underfitting ( less score) 
last3 days you didnt sleep study - exam you slept ( overfitting) 

train the model with more data - overfitting 
train th emodel with less data - underfitting 

overfitting & underfitting model will give high error less accuracy 

overfitting - train the model with more attribute

ridge = l2 = reduce or scale down high coeffiecient to low coeffient but it never brint 
						l2 ( coeffeince are never 0) ridge = loss + Penalty*2
				
lasso = l1 = reduce or scaled high eeffience to 0 thats mean remove the attribute 
					l1 as feature elimination tecnique 
					lasso = loss + penalty
				
No need to remember math equestion-- try to know wher it is implemebt

out of multiple line ( best fit line -- global minima) 

loss function == cost function 

GD  is an optimization algorithm to reach global minima by 
reducing cost function & increate the accuray by 
learnering rate very less = 0.0.1

GD -- math calculater for each and every datapoints 
dataaset has 1l data point -- math has to compute 1l time thats why 

SGD , BGD is much better over gd 
=====

GD - compution happend individual datapoints
sgd - reach globale minar random point, creat mean
bgd - batch wise point reach global mini

distance between 2 support vector is called marginal distacne  

distance between 2 support vector alwasy should be maximum but why

cuz if marginal distance is maximum then we can adjust the error

LOGISTIC REGRESSION ALGORITHM ==>
------
logistic regression  --> 
Is it regression algo or classificaiton algo 

math -->
if data set had outlier logistic regression give misclassification 
if the dataset has no outlier regression line will classifty the data

bydefaut considered as logistic regression as classificaiton algorithem it adjust outlier using probabiliyt function 

that probabiliyt function is called as sigmoid function 

 case-1 : y*mx > 0 
 case-2 : y*mx>0
 case-3 : y*mx<0 
 
when ever you are find this equation y*mx<0 ( wrong classification will happen) 

logistic regression also called as maxent classifier cuz we apply maximum datapoint
	
machine learning 2 algorithm we called as probabiliyt algorithm
	logistic regression 
	naive bayes 

deep learning this sigmoid function is called sigmoid activation function 

- confusion  matrix 
- model accuracy, precision, recall, error rate, f1 score 
- data without oultlier( logistic regression ) with oultier ( logit as classification)
	bydefault we are called logit as a classification algorithm not regresisn algorithm
	graph
- math ( why logistic reg also callas maxent classifier)
		cuz we maximumize the datapoint to get more accuracy 
- introuce probabiliyt function that probabiliyt function is called as sigmoid function 
- sigmoid function also called as s-curve
- dl sigmoid activate function 
- range of sigmoid curve is 0-1

  === 
 dataset -- you build multimodel ( can we rank algo based on accuracy) 
 LightGBM is a fast, distributed, high performance gradient boosting 
 framework based on decision tree algorithms.
 
 why lightgbm wemust used in our orgnaization , below are the reason 
===
Faster training speed and higher efficiency.
Lower memory usage.
Better accuracy
Support of parallel and GPU learning.
Capable of handling large-scale data.
===
Microsoft announced its gradient boosting framework LightGBM
LightGBM is 6 times faster than XGBoost.
Light GBM can handle the large size of data and takes lower memory to run
LGBM also supports GPU learning and thus data scientists are widely using LGBM for data science application development.

please work on project which try to write code with out seen kaggle code. alright

lets discus some tunning  -->
---
parameter tunning - syste parameter
hyperparameter tunning - user change the system  paramter build models
modle tunning -- 	gridsearch cv & random search cv 
		gridsearch & random search is part of the cross validation 
		model which we build tunn the model itself 
finetunng -- tunning llm model paramter is called finetunning 
	finetune rag
	finetun llama

==== AI SECTION 

AUC ( AREA UNDER CURVE ( AREA OF CURVE)
ROC ( RECEIVER OPERATION CHARACTERSTICS )

we build confuions matrix every model 
confusion matrix graph is called auc & roc 

how the graph has 

AOC & ROC 
	X-axis - FPR ( False +Ve Rate)
	Y-axis - TPR ( True +Ve Rate) == RECALL ( SENSITIVITY) 

TPR (True Positive Rate) / Recall /Sensitivity == TP / TP + FN 
														specificity == TN / TN + FP 
														
FPR (False +Ve rate) = 1- spcificity  = FP / TN + FP 		

ml classification algorithms are complted

ml regression -- slr, mlr, svr, poly, dtr, rfr, xgboost regressor, lgbm regressor , 
							ann regression & time series 
		
ml classification -
	logistic regression ( sigmoid curve ( adjust outliers)
	svm ( max margin hyperaplance) 
	knn ( distance matrix) 
	dt ( gini , entropy, maxdpeht, gain) 
	rf ( ensabmle)
	nb ( probability) 
	xgboost 
	lgbm

prod server -- hk, uk, us ( collection database ) run 365 days 24/7 
app server 

deployment issue 
what are the challenges we face in deployment issue 

finally datasceint gather historica ldata from app server not prod server 

after build the model what is next step ?

^^^^^ 24th
github 
7yr back not using much 

project has assigned to team 

deploye make sure -- have to keep 1 folder
	testing code
	front end code
	deployment code 
	backend code
	page desing 

what are the challaenge IT guy face from application server to production server

1- open source  library ( free software we are use free library)
		company will pay to buys license for security

2- production server is too old ( 
		application sever you build latest version 
	6 months 

3- firewall | productoin server setup (application ) 
		production server would be faire 

4- some personal information 
		gender, phone, bank ( clause) 

5- very very important
	timer setup | production
			furhter please check the code timing ( 
		do not use xgboost ( lgbm)

6- data is very huge ( trian time will increase)
		production will be failure

=== clustering  - no dependent variable ( data is discrete)
grouping 

continous | binary | discrete 
point stop -- scores  100 | rating of meal 5 or 10 | 

pca -- principal componnet analysis) -- based on pc1, pc2, 
			math ( pca with logit)
k-means
hierarchical clustering 
dbscan -- used for outlier detection 

K-MEANS -->
