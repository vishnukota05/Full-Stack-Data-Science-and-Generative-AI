CONFIDENCE INTERVAL --

* In previous lesson we learn point estimators but they are not reliable
* Imagine if you are visit 5% of resturents in london and tell that average price of the meal is 22.50pound
* you may be close but the true value is not 22.50 somewhare around 20 to 25pounds isn,t it
* In this way you can create a condidence interval [20, 25], i would say that much more accurcy of the reallity 
* you are 95% confident that the population parameter lies between 20 & 25 pound
* remember you are not 100% sure untill you can go the entire population
* you visit the the 5% of the resturent & CI is -- [20, 25] & 5% chance that the population prameter is outside the range

LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE (CONFIDENCE LEVEL) --

* CL is denoted as (1- alpha) is called CL of the interval & vale of Alpha range b/w 0 to 1
* If we want to be 95% confident the parameter is inside the interval then 5% would be confidence level 
* If we have higher confidence level 99% then alpha would be 1%
* Lets see the formula is [[ FROM THE (point estimate - reliablity factor)*standard error + TO (Realiability factor * standard error) ]]
========================================================================================================================================
HOW TO CALCULATE THE CI - 

* A CI is the range within which you expect the population parameter to be & Its estimation is based on the data that we have in sample
* we can calculate CI in 2 ways - 1> when population variance known 2> population variance unknown
* lets see the example -- lets say you want to become datascientist and you are more 
  interested on salary what you are going to get & you aware that population Standard deviation of datascience sal is equeal to $15000
* you know salary are normally distributed (sample n =30 salary) formula for the CI with known variance is 
  (population mean will fall between sample mean - Z of alpha/2 times standard error and sampe mean + z of alpha /2 times standard error) 
* sample mean x bar is the point estimator, standard erro = standard deviation/no. of sample. finally SE = 2739
* Next check with factor Z of alpha/2, z is standarize varibale has a standard normal distribution, Alpha is when we define at the time of 
  confidence interval level e.g - confidence level is 95% then alpha - 5%, (99% -- 1%), based on this we can say that common Confidence level - 90%,95% & 99% 
  and their alpha value are = 10%, 5%, 1% // 0.1, 0.05, 0.01
* lets say we want to find the values for the 95% of confidence interval. alpha=0.05, we are lookin for z of Alpha/2 (Z 0.025) that means 1-0.025 = 0.0975
* corresponding Z comes from row & column table headers associated with cell
* now if you apply everything in the CI formula then you will get final Confidence interval
* lets repete the exercise with higher interval level of 99% with the example
* with the 2 example we will find the tradeoff between level of confidence you choose and estimate precission find narrower with 95% confidence & broader with higher confidence
