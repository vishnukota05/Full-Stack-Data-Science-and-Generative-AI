Interview question ?? 
Project -- How to extract the data ? 
	database 
	api ( application program interface)
	website
	standing cameras 
	drones 
	sensor 
---
about database -->
---
dataabse which store strucute data -- sql db 
	mysql, oracle, postgres 
database which store unstructure data - nosql db
	mongodb, Hbase , cassandar, etc
text will embeed vector form -- vector db ( LLM ) large language model 
	pinecone
	milvus
	qdrant 
	chromadb
sql db vd no sql db vs vector db & yesterday we are completed demo 
==== python introduction 
1- why python ? what is the power of python 
		if you guys install vscode, pycharm , anaconda -- you can practise using it 
2- student dint install please use google colab ( goolge software)
		no need to by heart any thing in programming language
3- father of python - guidoe van rosam
4- python name came from -- monty python flying circus 
5- python is very powerfull tool for -- bigdata, ds, gen ai, llm model
		azur cloude -- python, db - python ( python is everything)
6- python was released on 1989 (feb 20th 1991)
7- Java released on 1995 but no one use python till 2015 
		( ml -- borns + python || ai - python very library or framework 
8- platform independetly 
		no need to write separae code for win, mac, linux
		just write 1 code execute every platform 


Need to master on 3 category & python into 3 section 
	1- basic python
	2- advanced python
	3- oops python 
	4- dsa I will explain (optional) 
python : -- 4 space ( indentation) 
-------
organization -- company wil buy python for credential 
python cons -- python can not perform in mobile application like android

--- what is anaconda & why anaconda application is realy used for 
Anaconda is an open source[9][10] data science and artificial intelligence
distribution platform for Python and R programming languages. Developed by Anaconda,

pelase install software -- to start work regurlar session 
Software Installation: https://t.ly/YoRAA
---
IDE ( INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONEMENT)
--	
user or developer write the code, run the code, read the code, fix the error , 
when you write you will get bug (error)
developer to debug 
---
famous ide --> vs code | jupyter notebook | spyder | pycharm | google colab
=== python interpreter & compiler 
interpreter -- execute the code line by line
compilier -- executure entire code at once 
----
1- BASIC PYTHON -->

python variable -->
--
syntax -->
variable namne = value | a = 5 
a is the varaible store 5 int value 
b = 5.5 
b  
--------------
python if you write any code try to write the 1st letter of the concept 

1 - what is variable 
	variable also called as object also called as identifier which helps to assign a value 
2 - how to assigne variable 
	variable name = value  but (value != variable)
3- rules to define python variable 
	 1- variable == case sensitive 
	 2- variable cannot start with digit but end with digit 
	 3- variable no special characteer is allowed except _ #
	 4- keyword or reserved word cannot be variable 
	 5- variable has no lenght limit

-- PYTHON VARIABLE 
-- DATATYEP & TYPECASTING 

ONLINE TEAM NON-TECHNICAL ATTEND SESSION IN OFFLINE MODEL
variabale declaration == object declration  == identider declaration 
------
when you want to print only 1 variable -- print() not required 
when you print more variable -- print() 
by defaul every day use print()
-------
Function 2 type & function always endwith() 	
	inbuild() -- print()
	userdefine() 
	
^^^^^^^^^ 24th

Agenda for today session -->
	Data type 
	Type casting
	Github createion 
	Linkedin createion 
	
-- complex data type
		a + bj  ( a - real part | b - imaginary part | j - squre root of -1)
		only j letter is small or capital 
------
tricks to remeber -->
---
: --> bydefaul 4 spaces ( indentation)
fun always ends with ()
everytime we call with dot(.)
---
python data type we are completed
==============
type casting -->
	from other datatype to int & float
	from other datatypd to complex, str, bool
============
int -- data type 
fam() -- fam function with 0 argument 
family( dad, mom) -- dad, mom -- argument or parameter 
family1( d, m, s, d) -- 4 parameter 
---------
llm model --
	llama3 model trained with 405B parameter 
		you cannot build llm model in cpu 
------------
house( labour, daily wage, bricks, sand, cement, etc ------) 
True -- system consider as True only 

when we assigne true with opter +-*/ -- system understand is \
TRUE - 1 & FALSE - 0

steps to downlad classnote from google classrrom
----

dear team i will answer all of your question at last 
how to upload & download classnotes from google classrrom 

1- download winzip or winrar file from google 
2- google classroom 
3- just click on file which i shared 
4- right top corner 3 dots 
5- click on that - open in new window
6- download
7- rightclick - extract - all the file
8- just check the file extension 
	 .xlcs
	 .doc
	 .pdf
	 .ipynb ( interactive python notebook)
	 .py ( python file) 
	 
.ipynb & .py you need to open using jupyter file 

9- still if you have any question no worry i will explain later or 
	mentor can take your screen acces they can guide you 
	
PYTHON DATASTRUCTURE 
	inbuld ds 
	user defind ds 

data type --> we need to define only 1 value 
data structure --> we have declare more then 1 value 
	a = 5

matrix - collection of datastructure
datastrucute - collection of data types

python inbuild ds -->
	list 
	tuple
	set
	dict

append() - add the element or value at the end of the list 
	append only 1 argument user can pass
		

 list insid list -- nested list
 for inside for loop -- nested for 
 
inbuild or built in --> list is inbuild datastructure 
---
string indexing-->
---
forward index --> left - right 
backward index --> right - left 

slicing -->
	forward slicing
	backward slicing
	step slicing
	
FORWARD SLICING -->
---
[2 : 7] - left index 2nd index : 7th right indexing 
			2nd index : ( n-1) formula right index ( 7-1)
	OUTPUT -- 2nd - 6th 
--	
BACKWARD SLICING :
[-7 : -1] -- LEFT INDEX - 7 : -1-1 
	-7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2 
	
slicing -->

matrix --> n = n-1 everytime this formula should by apply to right index
---
step slicing -->
---
[1:10:3]
print the element from 1st index to 10th (n-1) 
	3 should be step count
	
empyty slice -- all element


append() - add the element at last
copy() - copy list
reverse() - reverse the element
remove() -- remove 1st element 
string indexg ( 2 type
	
	forward index  
	backward index 

slcing
	: - entire element
	forward slice
	backward slice
	step slice 

^^^^^^ 28th 
when ever you upload your notes in classroom make sure upload pdf 
---
Basic python 
---
string vs raw string

ml, nlp
when we read any file from the specif folder location we must need to use 
	r before the location ( raw string) 
	i will explain this clarity on pandas , session indepth)
	
string
raw string (r) - detect the path location 

_ == it store previous value or previos results
	where to apply in future ( open cv model 

s[1:] --> print the element from 1st indext till last 
s[:7] --> print the element from 1st indext to n-1 (6th index)

i wnat you to change the string 'fine' to 'dine'

string is immutable -- not chagaable 

no constant concept in python . we have only variable 
---
PYTHON BASIC OPERATORS -->
---
ARITHMETIC  ( + - * / // % **) 
ASSIGNMENT ( =, +=, -=, *=, /=, //==)
RELATIONAL (we are using this operator for comparing)
			> , < , >=, <=, ==, !=

LOGICAL ( and , or, not)
UNARY ( ONLY 1 OPERATOR)  - OPERATOR 
	
and operator ==>
	1 and 1 = 1 (rest of them are 0)

or operator ==>
	0 or 0 = 0 (rest of them are 1
--------
NUMBER SYSTEM CONVERTION -->
--------
binary number system (base value 2) 
	0 & 1 
octal number system (base value 8) 
	0 -- 7
decimal number system (base value 10) 
	0-9
hexa decimal number system ( base value 16)
	0-9 , a-10, b-11, c-12, d-13, e-14, f-15
==
Number system we can use in every system -- ip addres we can use this number system

how to swap 2 varible in python 

a, b = 5, 6

a = 6
b = 5


xor -- xclusive or 

swap the 2 variable
	1- using temp (3rd variable)
	2- using operator
	3- can you swap using bit number ( use print(0b101| ob 110)
	4- using XOR ( i will explain tomorrow)
	5- a, b = b, a 

slicing & indexing concept in string datatype
slicing & indexing oncept we undersin list datastrucute
slicing & indexing we will used matrix
slicing & index conpcet we will machine leanring 


l[::-1] -- print the element revers wiser
l[::-2] -- print every -2 step 

pop & remove 

# remove -- we need to define value or element 
	value or element wise 
# pop - index wise remove

type casting
operators 
Indexing, slicing


append() - append the element or value at last 
remove() - remove value from the list 
pop() - pop the element or value by index ( bydefault is at last)
	pop(1) - 1st index value will elimiated 
copy() - copy the list 
insert() - insert the value before index 
	makes ure insert required bydefault 2 argument
		1st arg - index position 
		2nd arg - value 
		value will add before index 
clear() - clear the elmenet from the list 
	del the use del keyword 
reverse() - reverse the list 

list is mutable (changaable) hashable 


my humble request to 7pm fsds , genai batch any quest your brain send you on practilce
