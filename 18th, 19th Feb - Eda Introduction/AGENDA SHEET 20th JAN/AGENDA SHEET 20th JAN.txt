sql db vd no sql db vs vector db & yesterday we are completed demo 
==== python introduction 
1- why python ? what is the power of python 
		if you guys install vscode, pycharm , anaconda -- you can practise using it 
2- student dint install please use google colab ( goolge software)
		no need to by heart any thing in programming language
3- father of python - guidoe van rosam
4- python name came from -- monty python flying circus 
5- python is very powerfull tool for -- bigdata, ds, gen ai, llm model
		azur cloude -- python, db - python ( python is everything)
6- python was released on 1989 (feb 20th 1991)
7- Java released on 1995 but no one use python till 2015 
		( ml -- borns + python || ai - python very library or framework 
8- platform independetly 
		no need to write separae code for win, mac, linux
		just write 1 code execute every platform 


Need to master on 3 category & python into 3 section 
	1- basic python
	2- advanced python
	3- oops python 
	4- dsa I will explain (optional) 
python : -- 4 space ( indentation) 
-------
organization -- company wil buy python for credential 
python cons -- python can not perform in mobile application like android

--- what is anaconda & why anaconda application is realy used for 
Anaconda is an open source[9][10] data science and artificial intelligence
distribution platform for Python and R programming languages. Developed by Anaconda,

pelase install software -- to start work regurlar session 
Software Installation: https://t.ly/YoRAA
---
IDE ( INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONEMENT)
--	
user or developer write the code, run the code, read the code, fix the error , 
when you write you will get bug (error)
developer to debug 
---
famous ide --> vs code | jupyter notebook | spyder | pycharm | google colab
=== python interpreter & compiler 
interpreter -- execute the code line by line
compilier -- executure entire code at once

python variable -->
--
syntax -->
variable namne = value | a = 5 
a is the varaible store 5 int value 
b = 5.5 
b  
--------------
python if you write any code try to write the 1st letter of the concept 

1 - what is variable 
	variable also called as object also called as identifier which helps to assign a value 
2 - how to assigne variable 
	variable name = value  but (value != variable)
3- rules to define python variable 
	 1- variable == case sensitive 
	 2- variable cannot start with digit but end with digit 
	 3- variable no special characteer is allowed except _ #
	 4- keyword or reserved word cannot be variable 
	 5- variable has no lenght limit

ONLINE TEAM NON-TECHNICAL ATTEND SESSION IN OFFLINE MODEL
variabale declaration == object declration  == identider declaration 
------
when you want to print only 1 variable -- print() not required 
when you print more variable -- print() 
by defaul every day use print()
-------
Function 2 type & function always endwith() 	
	inbuild() -- print()
	userdefine() 
	
^^^^^^^^^ 24th

Agenda for today session -->
	Data type 
	Type casting
	Github createion 
	Linkedin createion 
	
-- complex data type
		a + bj  ( a - real part | b - imaginary part | j - squre root of -1)
		only j letter is small or capital 
------
tricks to remeber -->
---
: --> bydefaul 4 spaces ( indentation)
fun always ends with ()
everytime we call with dot(.)
---
python data type we are completed
==============
type casting -->
	from other datatype to int & float
	from other datatypd to complex, str, bool
============
int -- data type 
fam() -- fam function with 0 argument 
family( dad, mom) -- dad, mom -- argument or parameter 
family1( d, m, s, d) -- 4 parameter 
---------
llm model --
	llama3 model trained with 405B parameter 
		you cannot build llm model in cpu 
------------
house( labour, daily wage, bricks, sand, cement, etc ------) 
True -- system consider as True only 

when we assigne true with opter +-*/ -- system understand is \
TRUE - 1 & FALSE - 0

steps to downlad classnote from google classrrom
----

dear team i will answer all of your question at last 
how to upload & download classnotes from google classrrom 

1- download winzip or winrar file from google 
2- google classroom 
3- just click on file which i shared 
4- right top corner 3 dots 
5- click on that - open in new window
6- download
7- rightclick - extract - all the file
8- just check the file extension 
	 .xlcs
	 .doc
	 .pdf
	 .ipynb ( interactive python notebook)
	 .py ( python file) 
	 
.ipynb & .py you need to open using jupyter file 

9- still if you have any question no worry i will explain later or 
	mentor can take your screen acces they can guide you 
	
PYTHON DATASTRUCTURE 
	inbuld ds 
	user defind ds 

data type --> we need to define only 1 value 
data structure --> we have declare more then 1 value 
	a = 5

matrix - collection of datastructure
datastrucute - collection of data types

python inbuild ds -->
	list 
	tuple
	set
	dict

append() - add the element or value at the end of the list 
	append only 1 argument user can pass
		

 list insid list -- nested list
 for inside for loop -- nested for 
 
inbuild or built in --> list is inbuild datastructure 
---
string indexing-->
---
forward index --> left - right 
backward index --> right - left 

slicing -->
	forward slicing
	backward slicing
	step slicing
	
FORWARD SLICING -->
---
[2 : 7] - left index 2nd index : 7th right indexing 
			2nd index : ( n-1) formula right index ( 7-1)
	OUTPUT -- 2nd - 6th 
--	
BACKWARD SLICING :
[-7 : -1] -- LEFT INDEX - 7 : -1-1 
	-7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2 
	
slicing -->

matrix --> n = n-1 everytime this formula should by apply to right index
---
step slicing -->
---
[1:10:3]
print the element from 1st index to 10th (n-1) 
	3 should be step count
	
empyty slice -- all element


append() - add the element at last
copy() - copy list
reverse() - reverse the element
remove() -- remove 1st element 
string indexg ( 2 type
	
	forward index  
	backward index 

slcing
	: - entire element
	forward slice
	backward slice
	step slice 

^^^^^^ 28th 
when ever you upload your notes in classroom make sure upload pdf 
---
Basic python 
---
string vs raw string

ml, nlp
when we read any file from the specif folder location we must need to use 
	r before the location ( raw string) 
	i will explain this clarity on pandas , session indepth)
	
string
raw string (r) - detect the path location 

_ == it store previous value or previos results
	where to apply in future ( open cv model 

s[1:] --> print the element from 1st indext till last 
s[:7] --> print the element from 1st indext to n-1 (6th index)

i wnat you to change the string 'fine' to 'dine'

string is immutable -- not chagaable 

no constant concept in python . we have only variable 
---
PYTHON BASIC OPERATORS -->
---
ARITHMETIC  ( + - * / // % **) 
ASSIGNMENT ( =, +=, -=, *=, /=, //==)
RELATIONAL (we are using this operator for comparing)
			> , < , >=, <=, ==, !=

LOGICAL ( and , or, not)
UNARY ( ONLY 1 OPERATOR)  - OPERATOR 
	
and operator ==>
	1 and 1 = 1 (rest of them are 0)

or operator ==>
	0 or 0 = 0 (rest of them are 1
--------
NUMBER SYSTEM CONVERTION -->
--------
binary number system (base value 2) 
	0 & 1 
octal number system (base value 8) 
	0 -- 7
decimal number system (base value 10) 
	0-9
hexa decimal number system ( base value 16)
	0-9 , a-10, b-11, c-12, d-13, e-14, f-15

a, b = 5, 6

a = 6
b = 5


xor -- xclusive or 

swap the 2 variable
	1- using temp (3rd variable)
	2- using operator
	3- can you swap using bit number ( use print(0b101| ob 110)
	4- using XOR ( i will explain tomorrow)
	5- a, b = b, a 

slicing & indexing concept in string datatype
slicing & indexing oncept we undersin list datastrucute
slicing & indexing we will used matrix
slicing & index conpcet we will machine leanring 


l[::-1] -- print the element revers wiser

Indexing, slicing


append() - append the element or value at last 
remove() - remove value from the list 
pop() - pop the element or value by index ( bydefault is at last)
	pop(1) - 1st index value will elimiated 
copy() - copy the list 
insert() - insert the value before index 
	makes ure insert required bydefault 2 argument
		1st arg - index position 
		2nd arg - value 
		value will add before index 
clear() - clear the elmenet from the list 
	del the use del keyword 
reverse() - reverse the list 

list is mutable (changaable) hashable

Client - ESPN , STAR SPORTS 
use case -- they have dataset ipl cricket team dataset 
7pm batch - dataanlyst 
company - NIT 

CLINET -- NIT ( 
PROBLEM STATEMENT --
		PLEASE ANALYST THE DATA AND FIND THE TRENDS, PATTERN, INSIGHT OF THE DATASET)
NIT - if you analyst the data theny nit manager and you talk to the client 

based on your analyst if the client is satified busines will increate
salry will increa, promotion increate 
you got new client ( more hiring ) 
========

1- the import functin numpy i explain in the classes 
2- numpy all function document i shared 
3- easy if you have any question on numpy function ( connect to the mentor)
4- not require to teach like kids by every function 
5- math 1000table ( 30 tbale) but you make 1000 multication 
6- numpy what important things thats good enough
7- i will give another document , 4hr do interview, 
8- we will project in numpy + plt + panda + seaborn 


the one who analyse historical data & find insight, trends, pattern 
	is called data anlayst using tools called sql, python, eda, excel, libra, table, power bi 

we have 10yr historical data 


OFFLINE -- many of the student attend online 

we import the dataset
print the matrix

TIPS -->
--

if any day if you not feel well sometime you divert to the class 
-- once review the class 
-- dont take recoding ( classnotes, )
-- before joined please review review what are topic i covered
-- review that it
-- dont i didnt able to complete 
-- 6 monh 1yr ( 6mont - 4-5 yr experin)

why to create enviroment variable 

if any user purchase new laptop
cmd -- python -- automatically -- playstore will open -- please instal python 
try to check -- it will work 

still if it not works -- then we need to create environment calls

- STEPS TO SET UP EXECUTE PYTHON IN SYSTEM CMD (TO CREATE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE)
-----
- Open cmd # python (You will get error when you execute 1st time)
search with environment variable - system variable:
   (C:\Users\kdata\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps)
restart the cmd & type python in cmd it will work now

if you have any question -- work -- any thing( discuss me) 
I went offline lab ( 4people)
show ( planning is very very important)

many student are give up very easy becuas e-- they dont listen properly and dont working the practicle
concentration + practise + resume prep + more project + interview more attned + flunk fail the interview + just 1st round  == ( 1st step of succese)

after that 3 interview -- offer 
increase your 

every one kaggle.com( college, company, class, after class ) 
	friend ( guide), chatgpt, deepseek 

NUMPY -- very good practilce
pandas -- we complete ( gdp analysis, imdb movie rating)
matplotlibe -- visualzzaiton incomplete without plt & sns

data analyst ( you musst )

no need to import any dataset for this project 

get current figure (.gcf)
get current axis(.gca)

do i need to remember all the code --

orgnaization ( no body know anything) -- copy google, kaggle

no need to remember any code 
present of mind, smart ( how to get code , concept ) 

google -- 90% come to road 


plot -- you can plot only 1 graph as output
.subplot -- you will more then 1 graph ( easy way 

linear vs non-linear 
	linear -- bydefault is degree 1
	non linear -- degree is > 1 == non linear graph 

how to plot linear graph vs non linear graph
