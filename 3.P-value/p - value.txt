* we learnt how to test hypothesis & how to reject null hypothesis
* also we checked at various level significance but we couldn't find the significance level whcih 
  we can no longer do it
* This is the right time to introduce the p-value
* p-value is most common way to test hypothesis
* insted of testing a pre assign level of significance we can find the smallest level of significance 
  at which we can still reject the null hypothesis, given observed sample statistics 
* we called the test as datascientist salary, we had standard error as 2739, known populaion standard deviation is 15000
* Normally distribution of sample size is n = 30, coresponding Z score is Z = -4.67
* We rejected teh null hypothesis at 0.05  and 0.01 
* check the z-table of 4.67 same result which will get at -4.67
* in most z-table you not find this value which 0.07 as it is so large thus we round up the closer value avilabe and we will get as 0.0001

* How do we test  the hypothesis - after choosing the significance level of alpha you compare the p-value to it
* you reject the null hypothesis if p-value is lower then the significance level therefore we say that such results are extremly significant
  with any measurments
* lets see another example if our Z-score is 2.12 you will reject the null hypothesis at 5% but not reject at 1% significnce level
* lets look at the z-table value that corespond to 2.1 and find that 0.983
* p-value of one-side test is = 1 - 0.983 = 0.017 so correspond p-value is 0.017
* p-value of two-side test is =(1-0.983)*2 = 0.034
* where and how p-value used - most statistical s/w calculat p-value for each test
* researcher decides significance post -factum
* p-values are usually found with 3 digits after the dot.000
* the closer to 0.000 the p-value, the better
* finally p-value is a universal concept that works with all distribution
* whatever the test you do p-value is lower then the significance level then y ou rejec tthe null hypothesis
* if p-value is <0.05 then we will reject the null hypothesis
* if p-value is>0.01 then we will accept the null hypothesis
