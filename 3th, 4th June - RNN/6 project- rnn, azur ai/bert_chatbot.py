Data scientists work with large amounts of data to solve real-world problems. It's about turning data into smart decisions.",
    "what is your use":"A BERT-based chatbot uses the BERT model to understand and respond to user queries by analyzing the context of the conversation. It can handle tasks like answering questions, providing information, or engaging in dialogue by comparing user inputs with predefined responses or generating replies. BERT's deep understanding of language helps the chatbot give more accurate and context-aware answers.",
    "What is ai":"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability of machines to simulate human intelligence. It enables systems to learn from data, make decisions, and perform tasks like understanding language, recognizing images, or solving problems. AI aims to make machines think and act intelligently.",
