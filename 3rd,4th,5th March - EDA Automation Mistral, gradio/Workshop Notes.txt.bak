^^^^ Welcome to Saturday Workshop -->
EDA Automation --> Ollama, Mistral & Gradio
=====


1- My Introduction
		
2- explaratory data analysis --> existing workhop please watch it 

			raw data  - dataset which has missing value ( excel sheet)
			clean data - dataset which doesnot has any missing value 
we need to clean data then we go for visualization - imputation - ml model 
	
EDA technique is very important to convert raw to data - clean data 
	imputation technique ( transformer -- dummy varib\le)
	 which transform categorical value to number 
	 we build for machine learning model prediction 

if you load dataset - it will display top 5 rows
info - information of the dataset
.describe() -- descriptive stat of the dataset


if data has any missing value eda technique would help to fill missing value 
	numerical data -- mean, median, mode
	categorical data -- mode & knn 

outlier -- stats datapoint which is very far from other observation 

corelation -- relation amoung 2 attribute ( corelation 
		+ve corr ( 0-1)
		-ve corr (-1 to 0)
		0 corr 

EDA intro -- we just done 

3> LLM model -- who developed it ( 
using langchain framework we will build chatgpt 
		mistral AI

4> Start the project -->
	google
	ollama --> we build llm locally (local system) 
	download as per window os - install it 

no internet is required after installation of ollama 
		ollama
		ollama list
		ollama pull mistral
		ollama run mistral 

 as team we work with mistral 
	 
5- lets fetch the dataset 
		i want you to download 2 dataset ( titanic dataset) 
		we understand the dataset

6- grdio 
	vs code 
	pip install gradio 

7- we will test gradio 
	
		ollma installed
		mistral installed 
		undrstand dataset 
		gradio
	
Titanic dataset i will mistral will find the insight of the dataset


everyone has to comment 
share to your loved onee
	eda -- data analyst, business analyst 

automation locally without using any api 
python function , loop
eda,
