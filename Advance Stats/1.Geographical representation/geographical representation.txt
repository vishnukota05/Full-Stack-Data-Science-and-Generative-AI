* Lets check out the simple linear equation & everybody aware of the regression line
* when you plot the datapoint on x & y regression line is best fit line for the datapoints
* the grey points that are scattered are observed value, intercept b0 is the constant 
  & the one (b1) is the slope of the regression line
* the distance b/w observed value and the regression line is the estimator of the error we called as EPSILON
* Point estimator is called as residual
* Now if you draw a perpendiculare from the observed point to the regression line intercept b/w that perpendicular
  line is a point value y is equal to y hat
* as we discussed earlier given in x, y hat is the predicted by the regression line

* Linear regression example -- hear we have dataset with sat grade and collge gpa 
* total sat score = critical reading + mathmetics + writing
* gpa = gade point average at graduation from college
* we have to find the corelation b/w 2 variables
* Sample corelation(SAT,GPA) is 0.64 & then further test if this corelation is significally test with hypothesis testing
* we will confirm that 2 variables are corelated
* No information about under or overachievers. no predictive ability
* As per the graph of the sat score x-axis - sat score, y-axis = gpa & second one the situation is reversed
* we have also inculded the regressin line, we have 2 regression. should we use both to make prediction & whats the causal relationship
* should we use both to make prediction, this is the hardest part to find out which one you will use
* one provides valuable insights but other provides wrong information but 2 variables are definitely corelated
* we already tested before how to find the corelation b/w 2 variable we will get as 0.64 we have to find the cause b/w these 2 variable
* Lets think about the problems - you attend the SAT you get an SAT score, with this score you applied the college, in next 4 yrs you attend college
  you will receive a many grade then form a gpa, what is this mean this mean fist is sat score then gpa
* we can say that 2 nd regression is meaningless
* whenever you find the data that looks regressable, you should not drive straight into 
  regression analysis,caution and logic should be applied beforehand
* lets look at other logic part -- what is rationale -- the sat is considered one of the best estimation of intellectual capacity and capability
* if you get good sat score then you will get good college and good at workplace
* Almost all colleges across the usa are using sat as a first part for admission
* you could see the best fitting line b/w points aka the regression line
* x is independent variable is SAT score & y is dependent variable which is gpa 
* equeation that we get as (y hat = b0+b1x1) yhat = 0.48 + 0.0015x how can we use this equeation
* example you got 1700 sat score you insert this value  you get the predicted gpa is 3.03
* If you attend this specific college and if you are admitted in sat score of 1700 then model predict that you will graduate with gpa is 3.03
* What if sat score is 2000 then predicted gpa is 3.48
