
* In this class i will explain ANOVA framework. there are 3 terms must define- 
   1> sum of squares total 2> sum of squares regression 3> sum of squares error
* sum of squares total denoted as SST-- is the sum squer difference b/w observed dependent variable and its mean
* SST it is the measures the total variablity of the dataset
* sum of squares regression SSR -- It is the sum of squre difference b/w predicted value and the mean of the dependent variable
* SSR explained variability by your line, it descibribe how well the line fit the data
* sum of squars error (SSE) - Error is the difference b/w observed value & predicted value, we usually want to minimise the error
* smaller the error better the estimation power of the regression
* what is the connection amoung these 3 - (SST = SSR + SSE) TOTAL VARIABILITY = EXPLAINED VARIABLILITY + UNEXPLAINED VARIABLITY
* now we will see how to compare different regression model

==================================================================================================================================

* So far we decompose total variability of the observed data into explained(SSR) & unexplained (SSE)
* Let me introduce R Square = SSR/SST(variability explained by the regression)/total variablity of the dataset
* so what is the meaning - it is the relative measue ranging from 0 to 1, R2 at 0 means the regressin line explaine non of the variablity
  R2 at 1 explaines the entire variability of the data
* variability ranging from 0.2 to 0.9 so all statistican sugguest that r-square of 0.2 (20%) variability explained by the model 
* lets think about income once more- it may depend on household income including your parent & spose,education, yr of experience,country you are living in, 
  language you speak,this made still account for less then 50% variability of income,salary is very complex issue
* lets check the exam which we saw of sat score and college gpa , we proved that sat score is main key part to decide college gdp
* our regression had R2 of 0.406 or sat score explained 41% of variability of the college grade for our sample
* R2 of 41% is neither good nor bad but since it is far away from 90% we may conclude we are missing some thing
====================================================================================================================================
* what is ordinary least squares method (ols)--
* ols stands for min SSE and you can say taht lower erro = better explanatory power so this
  method aims to find the line which minimise the sum of squared error
* Lets clarify this things with the graph we have many lines to fit the data, ols determines the one line with smallest error and graphically
  It is the one closest to all points finally we got the line as this one. but how this formula is applied based on minimum calculus & linear algebra 
  to determine slope and intercept of the line, by knowing the coefficient hear the regression equation is you can do that in paper also, 
* but in dataset you have 1000 of value which is impossible to calculus now a days regression analysis is done through software 
* we have other method to determine the regression line such as - bayesian regression, kernel regression, gaussian process regression
