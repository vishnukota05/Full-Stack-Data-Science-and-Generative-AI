* so far we learnt simple linear regression but no we are learning multivariate linear regression
* when you have multiple variable then we use multivariate analysis 
* house price will depend on many factors such as - size,locatin & year of construction
* college gpa can not be depends on only SAT score like they other income,gender and so on.
* if we want good model then we need multivariate regression & the more variable you have the more
  factor you are considering in a model & sometimes things depnd on more then 20 factors
* lets see the formula as per given slides
* what is the main difference is more independent variables not one
* y hat - predicted / inferred value, b0 - intercept 
* x1,x2, till xk -- independent variable & b1,b2 till bk are their corresponding coefficient
* Multivariae is not the best fitting line anymore
