* We already saw Rsquard what actually it does, lets see the slides
* Adjusted R2 bar< R2
* If you look at the example R squard is 0.406 & adjusted R squard is 0.399
* now add other variable called random to assign each students
* we are 100% sure that this table cannot predict any gpa, so this is new model
* lets see the equatoin
* lets see the new table after increase the power we will get new r-squre values
* that why you always exclude useless information
* lets compare the models simple linear regression & multivariate liner regresino 
* adjusted r square alway use in multilinear regression
