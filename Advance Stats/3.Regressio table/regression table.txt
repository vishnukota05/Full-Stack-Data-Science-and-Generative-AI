* We can work with Regression analysis using software & software provides couple of tables then insted of graph 
* Now we will understand this table-- normally we have 3 tables
* First one is model summary , Second one is ANOVA, Third one is table with coefficient
* model summary - it contains R square , sample size & standar error
* we know what is the R-squared -- R-squared measures how much of variability of the data is explained by your model
* The standard error is a correction of the standard deviation of the sample size
* not required to much indepth just remember The bigger the sample size, the lower the error, the better the model

* Second table is ANOVA is the Analysis variance and it is a collection of statistical model used for comparing means
* we alreayd saw about SST,SSE,SSR, in ANOVA table we already found F-statistics, we will descuss in separate lesson

* Third table is coefficient table - this is heart of the regression
* First row describe the intercept & second row is independent variable & lets go column by column
* First column is coefficient, we can see the coefficient of intercept 0.4803, B0 = 0.4803
* looking below we have other coefficient 0.0015 this is our b1=0.0015
* to define the regression equation these 2 no.s are must required 
* finally get the equation as yhat = 0.4803+ 0.0015x
* Next we standard error on each estimate 
* Last columns are t-statistic and its p-value & if you close attention to this then you might know about hypothesis test 
  is involved hear, null hypothesis test is H0:B = 0 in other wards coefficient is 0
* if the coefficient of the intercept is 0, the line crosses they y-axis is at origin
* we discuss earlier in this course about p-value we are longing for the 0.000 but always researcher to choose the significance level
