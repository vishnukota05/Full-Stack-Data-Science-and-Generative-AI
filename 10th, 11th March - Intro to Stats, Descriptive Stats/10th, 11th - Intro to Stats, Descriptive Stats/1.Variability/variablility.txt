*** MEASURES OF --- 1> Central Tendency
	    	    2> Asymmetry
                    3> Variability

* There are many ways to quantify the variablity but we will focus most common one -- 
			<i> variance 
			<ii> standard deviation
			<iii> Coefficient of variation
* we do understand about population and sample, also we called as population data & sample data
* when you have only population data that mean you can calculate measure as per populatin data points
* same way when you take the sample of the population we can say that approximation of population parameter
* if you extract 10 different sample from the population you will get 10 different measures
* sample mean is the average of the sample datapoint & population mean is average of population datapoints
* Technically 2 different formula but they are computed in same way
* Now lets talk about VARIANCE

(PART-3)

VARIANCE --

* Variance measures the dispersion of set of datapoints around their mean value
* population variance denoted by (sigma squre) = sum of square differences b/w observed value & the population 
  mean divided by total no. of observation
* sample variance is denoted by s2 = sum of square differences b/w observed sample value & the sample mean 
  divided by the no. of sample observation minus 1
* We are doing square- because we will get the non-negative value & dispersion(distance) cannot be negative

* Now lets understand with example of population variance
* we have population of 5 observation(1 to 5) lets find the variance by calculation their mean & after we apply 
  the population formula not sample formula & all of componenets have to be divided by 5 we get the population 
  variance of the dataset = 2
* what about sample variance -- sample variance formula is used when our set of observation is a sample drawn 
  from a bigger population
* sample variance everything is same insted of 5 numerator is 4 & we will find the sample variance is 2.50
* In variance we could identify the spread of the data
