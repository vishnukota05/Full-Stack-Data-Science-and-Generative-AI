* we are learning descriptive statistics
* We learn what is the measurment of central tendency -mean,median & mode

SKEWNESS -- (part-1)
 
* what is the measurment of asymmetry - most common tool to measure asymmetry is skewness
* skewnes indicates whether the data is concentrated on one side or not
* last class we saw how to find frequency distribution table 
* we have 3 dataset & their frequency distribution table
* first dataset Mean > median in this condition we can say that +ve skew
* from the graph we can clearly say that datapoints are concentrate on the left side
* always rember in skewness always on which side tail is leading to
* right skewness is clearly shows that outlier to the right
* second dataset we can say mean = median = mode & frequency of occurance is completly symmetrical & we can 
  called as 0 assymetric or no skew
* 3rd dataset mean < median we can say that -ve skew & highest point defined by mode
* we called as left skew because outlier indicates to left
* why the skewness is important because skewness tell us where the data is situated
* mean,median & mode shoud be use together to get the good understanding b/w datasets
