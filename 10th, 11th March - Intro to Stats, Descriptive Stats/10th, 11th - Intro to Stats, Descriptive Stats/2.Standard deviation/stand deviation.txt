STANDARD DEVIATION (sd)- 

* SD is the much more meaningfull then variance
* sd formula also different for population sd & sample sd
* pop sd (sigma) = square root of sigma square & sample sd (s)= square root of s square

* Coefficient of variation (cv) = sd/mean. coefficient of variation is also called as relative SD
* SD is the most common measure of variability for single dataset but why we required other measures called as 
  CV because you cannot compare 2 dataset using SD but when you can comparing coefficient between 2 or more datasets.
* Lets see the example of prices of the pizza of 10 different places, n=10 & they range from $1 to $11
* imagin you have only mexican pesos is the mexican curency exchange rate from 1 dollar 18.81 to 206.91
* Now we have 2 dataset hear
* step - 1: are they sample or population? are they only 11 resturent in NY ofcourse they not so this would be sample
* step - 2 : we have to find the mean( mean of piza in dollar & mxn)
* step - 3 : find the sample variance * step - 4:find the standard deviation

* Now lets look at couple of observation -  variance gives result in square units while SD gives in originla units
* This is the reason why all professional used SD is the preferred measure of variablity, as it is directly interpretable
* same pizza, same resturent but different standard deviation which seems wrong now lets use last measure coefficient of variation
* dividing the sd by the respactive means we get the 2 coefficient of variation and the result would be same as 0.60
* if you notice that is not the dolar or pesos, dolar or pesos square . it is just 0.60 
* This is very good advantage coefficient of variation gives us & now based on this coefficient we conclude as 2 dataset has same 
  variablity & this is what we except 
* Finally we learnt the different measures of variability as variance, standard deviation & coefficient of variation
* This 3 we also called as univariate measures - measures of central tend, measures of asymmetry, measures of variability.
