PART - 5

* Now its time to see the measures when we work with more then one variable
* our main focus is one of the important topics called as covariance & linear corelation coefficient
* let me explain you with examples - Real estate - what determines house prices?
* their size - larger house is more expansive because people like more space & given table shows us size with price, hear we have 2 variables
* left side we have size for each house and right side we have price for the each houses
* Now we can present these datapoints in scatter plot (x-axis - size of the house) (y-axis -- prices of house)
* as per scatter plot there is clear relationship b/w these 2 variables 
* statistics we can say that 2 variables are corelated and the main statistics to measure this corelation is called as COVARIANCE.
* covariance may be (( +ve, equal to 0 or -ve)) // (( >0, =0, <0 ))
* to understand better I will show you the formula to calculate COVARIANCE b/w 2 variables
* once again sample formula & population formula
* the data is sample so we used the sample formula
* lets calculate mean of house size & house price
* next we will calculate the nominator of covariance function - (diffe b/w 1st house and averag house)*(diff b/w 1st house price and average house price)
* after that same goes to all 5 houses & finally you got the sum of all houses /// however our sample size is 5
* Now we have to devide the sum above and sample size - 1 & the result will give the co-variance
* finally it gives us sense of direction which way 2 variable are moving & please check the sense of direction
* >0 -- 2 variables move together (covar is +ve), <0 -- 2 variables move in opposite ( covare is -ve side), 
  =0 -- 2 variables are move independent( covar is neutral)(house size & price both are equal)
* but in covariance just 1 problem is number may be 5, 50 or 0.0023456 or 33,491,250, how can you interpret such numbers
  for this kind of problems we will go for next topics called as CORELATION OF COEFFICIENT
