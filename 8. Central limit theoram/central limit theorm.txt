CENTRAL LIMIT THEORAM - 

* CLT is one of the most important concept in statistics
* lets say given a dataset and distribution doesnot matter, distribution could be normal, uniform, binomial, Random distributoin
* first thing you have to do is take sample from the dataset . we called as sampling the data
* if i take 3 sample then i found the mean of 3 sample values & similar way if you take all sample and then calculate the mean of each sample 
  we will be apply central theoram
* No matter what ever the distibution in entire dataset mean of sample you took entire dataset it approximate to be normal distribution only
* lets see with example - we have prepared 960 random numbers, ranging from 1 to 1000 
* mean of the dataset is 489 & variance is 82,805 and lets take sampel of 30 random samples, consisting of 25numbers so (n=25)
* when we talk about sample size would be large then sample should be bigger then observation i.e (30>25)
* biger the sample size better the results you will get
* lets calculate the sample means plot them now its look like a normal distributed
