#you have to transform the 6.5 numerical value transform and fit to the regressor 
#we have to do the inverse transform to get the orginial scale & by using the inverse_transform then we will get the scaled prediction salary
#after execute we get very great prediction we found the predicted sal is 170k which is too good
#we can say that our svr model quite good model compare to polynomial regression, finally we can say that svr is great model

#in this case ceo is outlier hear becuase ceo is quite far from our observation, thats ok
