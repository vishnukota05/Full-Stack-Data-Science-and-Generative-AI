* student T-distribution looks like normal distribution but has fater tails
* fater tails remembers you higher rate of dispersion 
* Z-statistics related to the standard normal distribution
* T-statistics related to the students T-distribution
* T with n-1 degree of freedom & significance level of alpha = sample mean -population mean 
  divided by standard error of the sample. 
* sample of 20 observation degree of freedom is 19
* rows indicate different degree of freedom abbrebiated as DF while the columns are the Alpha
* if you check the table after 30th table no. is not varies much the reason why after 30 degree of freedom
  t-statistics table is almost same as z-statistics
* as the degree of freedom depends on the sample bigger the sample closer you get the no.
===================================================================================================
* lets revisit the example which we saw earlier ---
* you are aspiring datascienist & wnat to know how much average datascientist sal?
* you have 9 sample observation which you found in glassdor  & you do know how to calculate standard error
* we can use students T-distribution when variance unknown & also compare the 2 formula
* the 2 key difference between Z & T -- first point is - alpha/2 & T of n-1 -- second point is instead of sample standard deviation 
  you can use population standard deviation other wise everything is same
* everythins is same except above 2 points which are we discussed
* we will obtain the T-statistics from T-table & first step we have to find out the degree of freedom
* student T distribution degree would be n-1 as we have 9 observation so we have 8 degree of freedom
* second we have to devide alpha/2 & once again we have to find the confidence level , in this example we will find of CL of 95% so alpha = 5%
* now we can replace the value as per the formula what we will get as we found the CI
* Lets compare the result which we will got in known population - 
* Now clearly can tell that when you know the population variance we get narrow CI
  when you dnt know the population variance we get high uncertainity wity wider boundry of CI
* We learnt even though you dont know the variance we can still make prediction but prediction will be less accurate
========================================================================================================================
MARGIN OF ERROR -

* In past few lesson we concentrate on CI & we learn 2 situation - popul variance know (z) & population variance unknow(T)
* please check the formula about confidence formula & those part will decide the CI
* they are called margin of error 
* when population variance known then margin of error is given equation
* when population variance unknow then margin of error is given equation
* i can say that confidence interval will define as xbar + margin of error
* getting smaller margin of error means confidence intervdal would be narrower
* we can control the margin of error and bigger margine error with wide confidence interval
