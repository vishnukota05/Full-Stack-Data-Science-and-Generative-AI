* So far we covered DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS but now we INFERENTIAL STATISTICS.
* Inferential statistics mainly corelate on probability & distribution
* I would say the population value based on sample data
* we will understand what is distrbution, point estimates, confidence intervals before u get into datascience
=============================================================================================================
DISTRIBUTION -

* In statistics when we are talk about distribution = probability distribution
* E.g - Normal distribution, Binomial distribution, Uniform distribution
* Distribution is a function that shows the possible values for a variable and how often they occur.
* Rolling a die it has 6 sides - when you rolling a dia what is probability to get 1 = 1/6, probability of 2 = 2/6
* Impossible to get probability of 7 therefor the probability is 0
* the distribution of given event of rolling a die will be given the following table
* you can see the probability of all side equal to 100%
* Each probability distribution is associated with graph describing the liklihood of occurance of every event & this 
  type of distribution is called uniform distribution.
* To more understand distribution is defined by the underline probability not the graph & graph is just visual representive


* Now let us think about rolling two dice what are the possibilitie? (Total=36)
* whats the probability of getting '1' ?  --- <<answer is 0>> & this event is impossible becuase we never get 0 as we dont have 
  0 side 
* whats the probability of getting '2'? --- 1/36 (0.03)
* what is the probability of getting '3'? --- 2/36 (0.06) & same way we will continue the probability for 2 dice
* Now lets see the visual representive of the graph of rolling 2 dice
* Next we will see the continuous distribution
