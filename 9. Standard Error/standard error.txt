STANDARD ERROR - 

* standard error is the standard deviation of the distribution formed by sample means
* we know the variance -- sigma square / n ( therefore SD = ROOT OF SIGMA SQUARE /n)
* Meaning of standard error like any standard deviation, it shows variablity fo the sample means
* standard error used in most statistical tests becuase it show how well you approximated true mean
* when sample size increase the standard error is decrerases & bigger sample gives better approximation
